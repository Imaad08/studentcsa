My name is Imaad Muzaffer and I am a passionate coder who loves working his way around problems. I belive that you have to approach coding with a curious and embracing mindset. I enjoy embracing coding problems because each time I encounter a problem, I see it as a way to broaden my coding skillset and become a better coder in general. Another thing I love about coding, web development, specifically, is when you pour a lot of hard work into a website and it turns out looking exactly how you want. Frienship is also something I hold extremely close to me as I love being around my friends and laughing with them. This feeling makes me feel happy and brings a smile to my face.

- I enjoy working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and game development with Unity
