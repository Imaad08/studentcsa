# Welcome to the 5-Year Stocks Game!

## What is the 5-Year Stocks Game?

This is a fun game where you get to pretend you're investing in the stock market! You'll start with $10,000 and pick stocks you think will do well. The game will show you how your picks would have performed over the last 5 years - just like if you had really invested that money!

## How to Play

### Step 1: Pick Your Stocks

1. You'll see a search bar at the top
2. Type in a stock symbol (like AAPL for Apple)
3. Choose how many shares you want to buy
4. Click "Add Stock" to add it to your list
5. Keep adding stocks until you're happy with your picks

### Step 2: Manage Your Money

- You start with $10,000
- Each stock you buy costs money
- The game shows your remaining balance
- You can sell stocks if you change your mind
- Try to use all your money for the best results!

### Step 3: Run the Simulation

1. When you're happy with your picks, click "Submit Stocks"
2. The game will show you what would have happened
3. You'll see how much money you would have made (or lost)
4. This is based on real stock prices from 5 years ago!

## Tips for Success

### Choosing Stocks

### Managing Your Portfolio

- Keep track of how much money you have left

- You can always sell stocks if you want to try different ones
- Try to use most of your $10,000

## Common Questions

### How do I know if I have enough money?

### What happens after I submit my stocks?
