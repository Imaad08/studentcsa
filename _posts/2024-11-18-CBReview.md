  <h1>My Score and Quick Reflection</h1>
  <p>I scored a 34/40 which puts me right around the 4-5 range.</p>
  <p>
    I am pretty satisfied with this score at this point in time especially since it was my first practice MCQ. 
    For the questions I did get wrong, I understand most of my errors and what could have happened. 
    In the future I hope to iron out these issues by the time AP Exams roll around.

          I originally got this question wrong because of haste as I spent 46 seconds on it, confident in my answer. 
          A is incorrect as it will prevent an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if its not in the data set and if last was equal to 0 it would return -1. 
          The answer would have to be B as it will corectly throw the exception when last becomes -1.

          I spent the largest amount of time on the problem(3 minutes) but still ended up guessing on it as it was just too tricky and would require more time I wouldn't have on the AP exam. 
          A is incorrect because it wouldn't run if math.random gave a value of 0. B has to be correct because it includes 0.

          I chose C because I misinterpreted how the manipulate method reorders elements starting with "b." 
          I might have thought "baboon" would move to the front of the list, followed by the original order, 
          without fully considering the animals.size() - k logic. 
          However, this is incorrect because the method adds elements relative to their position from the end, 
          and following this process step by step results in B, where the elements are placed according to the loop’s backward iteration and removal logic.

          I chose D because I misinterpreted the relationship between n and the loop termination, thinking n could still be greater than 2 after the loop ends. 
          However, this is incorrect because Point C is reached only after the loop has endd, and by that time, n is always 2 or less.
          E is correct because Point B is inside the loop, which only runs when n > 2, ensuring that n is always greater than 2 whenever Point B is reached.

          I am honestly not sure what happened here or if I misclicked but the code concatenates digits by multiplying result by 10 and adding the last digit of num repeatedly, which correctly produces 4752.

          I initially selected option D, but it's incorrect because the print statement is executed after the recursive call, meaning the strings are printed as the recursion unwinds. 
          The correct answer is C because it prints "W", "WA", "WAT", and "WATC" as the recursion returns, with no output from the initial call.

My most missed categories were recursion and array lists. This was not too surprising as I have found myself struggling with these types of questions in the past and in extracurricular work.
