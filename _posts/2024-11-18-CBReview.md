# My score and quick reflection
- I scored a 34/40 which puts me right around the 4-5 range
I am pretty satisfied with this score at this point in time especially since it was my first practice MCQ. For the questions I did get wrong, I understand most of my errors and what could have happened. In the future I hope to iron out these issues by the time AP Exams roll around.

# Question 11

## Correction
I originally got this question wrong because of haste as I spent 46 seconds on it, confident in my answer. A is incorrect as it will prevent an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if its not in the data set and if last was equal to 0 it would return -1. The answer would have to be B as it will corectly throw the exception when last becomes -1.

# Question 18

## Correction
I spent the largest amount of time on the problem(3 minutes) but still ended up guessing on it as it was just too tricky and would require more time I wouldn't have on the AP exam. A is incorrect because it wouldn't run if math.random gave a value of 0. B has to be correct because it includes 0.

# Question 23
