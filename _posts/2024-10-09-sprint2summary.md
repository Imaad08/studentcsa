# AP Computer Science A Units 1-9 Summary

### Unit 1: Primitive Types

- **Overview**: Introduces the fundamental data types used in Java programming such as `int`, `double`, `boolean`, and `char`.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - How to declare and initialize variables and the importance of data type conversion.
  - Familiarization with various operators: arithmetic (e.g., `+`, `-`), relational (e.g., `>`, `<`), and logical (e.g., `&&`, `||`).
  - Evaluating complex expressions and understanding the order of operations in code.

### Unit 2: Using Objects

- **Overview**: Focuses on object-oriented programming, where students learn to create and interact with objects in Java.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Classes, instance variables, and methods form the building blocks of object-oriented programming.
  - Learning to utilize built-in Java classes like `String` and `Math` effectively.
  - Making method calls, passing parameters, and receiving return values to enhance interactivity within programs.

### Unit 3: Boolean Expressions and if Statements

- **Overview**: Introduces control flow structures that make decisions in a program using boolean logic.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Writing conditional statements using `if`, `else`, and `else if` to perform different actions based on boolean conditions.
  - Understanding the use of logical operators to combine multiple conditions.
  - Controlling the program’s flow by making decisions based on true/false evaluations.

### Unit 4: Iteration

- **Overview**: Covers loops, which allow repetitive execution of code blocks based on certain conditions.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Learning how to use `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops for repetitive tasks.
  - Understanding loop control through `break` and `continue` to manage iteration.
  - Applying iteration to solve problems efficiently, such as processing data or performing calculations multiple times.

### Unit 5: Writing Classes

- **Overview**: Explains how to design custom classes and structures in Java, which encapsulate data and behavior.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Creating constructors, defining methods, and utilizing instance variables to build functional classes.
  - Encapsulation and the importance of data hiding to protect class internals from unintended modification.
  - Using `this` to reference the current object and exploring method overloading for flexibility in functionality.

### Unit 6: Inheritance

- **Overview**: Introduction to inheritance, an important concept in object-oriented programming that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Creating a subclass from a superclass to reuse existing code and extend functionality.
  - Understanding polymorphism, where objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass.
  - Using `super` to call parent class constructors and methods, and exploring method overriding for custom behavior.

### Unit 7: Array

- **Overview**: Introduces arrays, a data structure that stores multiple values of the same type in a single variable.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Declaring, initializing, and accessing array elements, which allows efficient storage and manipulation of data.
  - Learning about multidimensional arrays and their use in storing complex data such as grids or tables.
  - Implementing array algorithms for tasks like searching, sorting, and traversing elements in large data sets.

### Unit 8: ArrayList

- **Overview**: Focuses on the dynamic data structure `ArrayList`, which allows for flexible data management in Java programs.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Creating and manipulating `ArrayList` objects to dynamically grow and shrink as elements are added or removed.
  - Exploring key methods such as `add()`, `remove()`, and `get()` to efficiently manage elements.
  - Comparing the benefits of using `ArrayList` over standard arrays for situations where the size of data may change.

### Unit 9: 2D Array

- **Overview**: Discusses two-dimensional arrays (2D arrays) used for organizing data in rows and columns.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Declaring and initializing 2D arrays for handling more complex data structures like tables or grids.
  - Accessing and modifying elements in a 2D array to perform operations across rows and columns.
  - Practical applications of 2D arrays, such as representing matrices in math or creating game boards in programming.

# Memory: The Maze Project

A standout moment in my programming journey was the maze project we completed in class. It was a team project that allowed us to apply multiple programming concepts in a real-world scenario. I was thrilled when we received the highest grade, which validated the dedication and hard work my team put into the project.

We built upon Mr. Mort's provided code, focusing on enhancing the maze's navigation system and overall functionality. The project exemplified the benefits of Problem-Based Learning (PBL) and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). By integrating these concepts, we were able to think critically and structure our code efficiently.

This project deepened my passion for programming and highlighted the importance of teamwork and problem-solving. It reinforced my desire to continue exploring complex challenges in computer science and applying creative solutions.

# Relevancy: Personal Finance Project

My team and I recently developed a personal finance application that consolidated everything we’ve learned in AP Computer Science A, particularly concepts from Units 1-9.

### Unit 1: Introduction to Computer Science

We applied problem-solving techniques to determine the project’s features, such as budget tracking and expense categorization.

### Unit 2: Program Structure

Breaking down the application into sections helped us design an effective structure, where each class and method had a clear role in the overall project.

### Unit 3: Primitive Data Types

We used primitive data types to store essential user information like income and expense data, ensuring that our calculations were precise.

### Unit 4: Using Objects

Object-oriented principles allowed us to design classes representing real-world entities (`Budget`, `Expense`, `Income`), promoting modularity and reusability in our code.

### Unit 5: Using Arrays

Arrays helped manage lists of expenses and income sources, enabling efficient data retrieval and manipulation when users reviewed their financial activities.

### Unit 6: ArrayList

We chose ArrayLists for flexible data handling, allowing users to dynamically add or remove financial records, which made the application more user-friendly.

### Unit 7: Control Structures

Control structures, including loops and conditional statements, allowed us to implement key features, such as calculating a user's financial summary based on inputs.

### Unit 8: Recursion

We employed recursion to calculate financial projections like compound interest, giving the users more insight into their long-term financial status.

### Unit 9: Inheritance and Polymorphism

We utilized inheritance and polymorphism by creating specialized classes for different types of expenses, allowing our application to adapt to various financial scenarios and making the code easier to maintain.

This project not only reinforced our understanding of AP Computer Science A topics but also provided a practical, real-world tool that can help users manage their finances effectively.
