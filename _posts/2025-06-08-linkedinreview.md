## 💹 Gamified Stock Market Simulator

**Open Coding Society** | _Sep 2024 – Present_

A competitive, educational platform where users simulate real-world stock trading with virtual currency, predictive insights, and gamified features. Built as part of the Open Coding Society’s mission to make finance and data science more approachable for students through engaging tech experiences.

### 🔧 Core Features

- **Real-Time Trading Engine**
  Users buy and sell real stocks using virtual currency in a live market environment, with prices synced to real-world data.

- **Machine Learning Integration**
  Integrated predictive models to forecast stock prices and generate buy/sell recommendations, offering users an intelligent edge in trading decisions.

- **Gamification & Leaderboards**
  Added game mechanics like streaks, badges, and global rankings to foster competition and incentivize engagement.

- **Interactive Dashboard**
  Built an immersive frontend in React with live portfolio tracking, trade history, and interactive Plotly charts for visualizing performance and market trends.

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation

- **Backend:** Flask API architecture managing transactions, portfolios, and UID-based user authentication
- **Frontend:** Fully responsive React interface with dynamic data rendering and real-time feedback
- **Database:** Structured SQLite schema linking users to transactions, stock history, and prediction logs
- **Visualization:** Real-time data graphs with Plotly for visualizing market activity and trends
- **APIs:** Integrated Yahoo Finance and custom endpoints for retrieving, processing, and predicting stock data

### 🌍 Learning Goals & Impact

- Empowered students to explore investing principles, market behavior, and risk management in a low-stakes virtual environment.
- Bridged CS, data science, and finance through hands-on simulations that prioritized accessibility and fun.
- Introduced beginner-friendly analytics while maintaining scalable architecture for advanced modules.

### 🧪 Public Showcases & Feedback

- Showcased the project at live exhibitions such as _Night at the Museum (N\@TM)_ where students, teachers, and visitors provided feedback.
- Iteratively improved user experience based on real-world testing and interface demos across devices.

### 📜 Certification: Data Structures & Algorithmic Thinking

Completed a structured articulation program focused on solving real-world problems using advanced graph algorithms and heuristic-based search methods.

#### ✅ Lesson 1: Greedy Best-First Search & Heuristics

Explored how Greedy Best-First Search uses heuristic estimates to quickly navigate complex graph problems by targeting the most promising paths first.
Learned how to balance **speed vs. accuracy** in search algorithms, with applications in areas like **AI pathfinding**, **network routing**, and **trading strategy optimization**.

#### ✅ Lesson 2: Dijkstra’s & A\* Search Algorithms

Mastered **A\***, understanding how it combines actual cost `g(n)` and heuristic estimates `h(n)` to outperform Dijkstra’s in many practical contexts.
Applied these concepts to design intelligent systems that evaluate trade-offs in efficiency and precision—key for **financial simulations**, **route planning**, and **machine learning inference paths**.
