# SMILE 101:

# SMILE: How Computers Learn from Data in Java

## What Is SMILE?

SMILE stands for **Statistical Machine Intelligence and Learning Engine**. That sounds like a mouthful, but it’s actually simple at heart. SMILE is a tool that helps computers learn from data — just like how we learn from examples. The cool part? It works in **Java**, which means anyone who knows basic Java programming can use it to make smart applications.

Imagine you had a friend who could look at a bunch of pictures of dogs and cats, and then — after seeing enough examples — tell you whether a new picture is a dog or a cat. That’s kind of what SMILE helps your computer do. You feed it the examples, and it learns the patterns.

## Why Is SMILE Useful?

Normally, teaching a computer to “learn” would require writing a lot of complex math code. SMILE saves you time by doing all that hard math behind the scenes. It gives you ready-made tools that are smart, fast, and easy to use. That way, instead of building a brain from scratch, you just plug in your data and tell SMILE what kind of learning you want to do.

This is especially helpful for students or developers who already know Java. If you’ve made apps or games in Java, now you can add machine learning to those projects — without switching to another language like Python.

## What Can SMILE Do?

SMILE is good at a few key things:

- **Classification** – This means putting things into categories. For example, SMILE can help your computer decide whether an email is spam or not by learning from past emails.

- **Prediction** – SMILE can look at past data to guess something in the future. For example, it might learn from past weather reports and try to guess tomorrow’s temperature.

- **Finding patterns** – Even if you don’t label your data, SMILE can group similar things together. This is like when Spotify recommends songs you might like based on your listening habits — it finds patterns without needing all the answers ahead of time.

## How Does SMILE Actually Work?

Here’s a simple way to understand how SMILE works:

1. **You collect data.** Maybe it’s test scores, animal pictures, or music choices.
2. **You pick a type of learning.** Do you want to sort things? Predict a number? Group similar things?
3. **SMILE looks at the data.** It runs the math behind the scenes and builds a “model” — kind of like a smart calculator that understands the patterns.
4. **You give it something new.** SMILE uses what it learned to make a decision or guess.

Think of SMILE like a recipe-following robot. You give it the ingredients (your data), tell it what you’re trying to make (classification, prediction, etc.), and it follows the steps to create something useful.

## Real-Life Examples of What You Could Build

Here are a few fun ideas you could actually make with SMILE:

- An app that predicts your next grade based on your past test scores
- A program that recognizes whether a drawing is a cat or a dog
- A tool that recommends clubs or activities based on your interests
- A spam detector for emails
- A tool that groups your playlist songs by mood

These all use data and patterns — and SMILE helps bring those ideas to life.

## Why SMILE Matters

In short, SMILE makes machine learning in Java way easier. You don’t have to be a math genius to use it. You just need to understand your data and what you want your program to learn. Whether you’re trying to build smarter apps, do a science project, or just understand how AI works, SMILE is a great place to start.

Questions to think about: 

1. What is SMILE and what is it used for?
2. Why is SMILE helpful for Java programmers?
3. If you could teach your computer one thing, what would it be?



### Using Graphs in Java
There are many libraries to do this, but let's build a class from scratch. We'll be using an adjacency list to store the information of the graph. 

##### Class


```Java
import smile.classification.KNN;

public class SmileKNNExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Our training data (features): [height in feet, weight in pounds]
        double[][] x = {
            {5.0, 100},  // Small
            {6.0, 150},  // Medium
            {6.5, 200},  // Large
            {5.2, 110}   // Small
        };

        // Labels for each data point: 0 = Small, 1 = Medium, 2 = Large
        int[] y = {0, 1, 2, 0};

        // Labels as strings for printing
        String[] labelNames = {"Small", "Medium", "Large"};

        // Train the k-NN model with k = 3
        KNN<double[]> knn = KNN.fit(x, y, 3);

        // New person to classify
        double[] test = {5.8, 140};

        // Make a prediction
        int prediction = knn.predict(test);

        // Print the result
        System.out.println("Predicted size class: " + labelNames[prediction]);
    }
}

```

## Homework - Part 2
The above class for graphs works for the purpose of what we're going to explain. However, in real usage, the following methods are likely needed. Please implement them.

1. addNode
    - Adds a node to the graph
    - No connections be default
2. removeEdge
    - Removes a specified edge from the graph
    - Does NOT remove the nodes
