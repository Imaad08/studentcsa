# Teaching Tablesaw Using the Titanic Dataset

This guide introduces **Tablesaw** for data prep and cleaning in Java, using the **Titanic dataset** as an example. It's focused on **clear analogies**, **visual thinking**, and **minimal code**.

---

## Goals

- Understand Tablesaw as a Java-based “smart spreadsheet.”
- Clean messy data: fill blanks, drop useless columns, encode categories.
- Normalize data for modeling.
- Convert Tablesaw `Table` to Weka `Instances`.
- Sketch model building (Decision Tree, Logistic Regression).

---

## 1. Tablesaw = Spreadsheet with Superpowers

- Think of Tablesaw as a programmable Excel sheet.
- Rows = passengers, columns = features.
- Lets you filter, transform, and visualize with Java code.

## 2. Titanic Data = Messy Kitchen

### Issues:
- **Missing values** (e.g., Age) → fill with median.
- **Useless columns** (e.g., Name, Ticket) → drop them.
- **Text columns** (e.g., Sex, Embarked) → convert to numbers.
- **Uneven scales** (e.g., Age vs. Fare) → normalize to [0,1].

### Sample Code:
```java
table.doubleColumn("Age").setMissingTo(table.numberColumn("Age").median());
table = table.removeColumns("Name", "Ticket", "Cabin");


3. Cleaned Data Snapshot
Pclass	Sex	Age_norm	Fare_norm	Embarked	Survived
3	     1	  0.27	      0.014	       0	       0
1	     0	  0.47	      0.143	       1	       1

Categories: Sex (male=1, female=0), Embarked (S=0, C=1, Q=2)
Normalize: (value - min) / (max - min)

4. From Tablesaw to Weka
Think of this as “packing your data into a suitcase” Weka understands.

Steps:
Define Attributes (numeric or nominal).

Create Instances and set Survived as the class.

Loop through rows to add instances.

```java
Instances data = new Instances("Titanic", attributes, table.rowCount());
for (Row row : table) {
  double[] vals = {row.getDouble("Pclass"), ..., ...};
  data.add(new DenseInstance(1.0, vals));
}


5. Modeling with Weka
J48 Tree: Splits based on conditions (e.g., Pclass ≤ 2).

Logistic Regression: Combines features into a prediction formula.

Cross-validation: Slice data into 10 parts, train/test each.

Example Tree Sketch:

Pclass ≤ 2?
 ├── Yes → Sex = female? → Survived
 └── No  → Fare_norm < 0.05? → Did Not Survive


6. Visual Ideas

- Histogram of Age before/after filling.

- Bar chart: survival by class.

- Scatter plot: Age vs. Fare colored by survival.



## Homework - Part 1
Look at the Titanic ML code for [Java](https://github.com/Open-Coding-Society/spring/blob/master/src/main/java/com/open/spring/hacks/tablesaw/TitanicML.java) and [Python](https://pages.opencodingsociety.com/csp%20big%20idea%202/2025/02/19/pandas-ml_titanic_IPYNB_2_.html). Where do you see similarities in code flow and structure?
