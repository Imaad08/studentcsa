title: OFFICE HOURS- Lessons Learned and Plans for the Future- Student Panel

One of the biggest takeaways for me is how important **communication** is. It's at the same level as actually writing code, which is something I hadn't thought about much before. Being able to explain yourself and your ideas is crucial—not just for collaborating with a team but also for figuring out solutions. Breaking down huge ideas into smaller, manageable pieces that can fit together is a skill I really want to work on. It's like taking something small, like a spark, and building it into a whole project.

Another thing I want to start doing is exploring GitHub more. There's so much out there—ideas, projects, and even inspiration for problems people are trying to solve. I also want to pay more attention to understanding the problems around me and figuring out how to make a difference, even in small ways.

When it comes to colleges, I've realized how important it is to show curiosity and make an impact in high school. Community projects could be a great way to do this. I think I sometimes overthink things, but I’ve learned it’s better to just go for it and talk about what I care about and what I've done.

Moving forward, I want to focus on not just improving my coding but also working on how I communicate and approach problems. I’ll keep reminding myself to think big but start small. I guess it's all about finding that balance. :)
