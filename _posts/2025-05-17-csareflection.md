# **Reflection on AP CSA: Teamwork, Growth, and Building My Biggest Project**  

**Class:** AP Computer Science A (CSA)  
**Teacher:** Mr. Mortensen  
**Key Skills Gained:** Teamwork, Problem-Solving, Full-Stack Development  
**Biggest Project:** **Stock Market Simulator Game** (Java + Firebase)  

---  

## **How CSA Shaped My Work Ethic & Team Skills**  

### **1. Learning to Work in Teams**  
Mr. Mortensen structured the class around **collaborative coding projects**, which taught me:  
- **Effective communication** (how to explain technical ideas clearly)  
- **Git & version control** (resolving merge conflicts, branching strategies)  
- **Agile workflows** (breaking tasks into sprints, daily standups)  
- **Giving & receiving feedback** (code reviews, debugging together)  

These skills **directly helped me land internships**, as interviewers were impressed by:  
- My ability to **articulate technical decisions**  
- Experience with **collaborative development** (GitHub, pair programming)  
- **Conflict resolution** (how I handled disagreements in team projects)  

### **2. Habits That Stuck With Me**  
- **Writing clean, documented code** â€“ Because "youâ€™ll thank yourself later"  
- **Breaking problems into smaller methods** â€“ Avoiding "monster code blocks"

## **The Stock Market Simulator: My Most Complex Project**  

### **Overview**  
A **Java-based stock trading game** where players:  
âœ… Buy/sell real-time stock data (via API)  
âœ… Compete on a leaderboard (Firebase integration)  
âœ… Learn investing strategies (tutorials, risk simulations)  

### **Tech Stack**  
- **Java (Processing UI)** â€“ Frontend visualization  
- **Yahoo Finance API** â€“ Real-time stock prices  
- **Firebase** â€“ User accounts & leaderboard  
- **Multi-threading** â€“ Handling live data updates  

### **Challenges & Lessons**  

**Key Takeaway:** This project taught me **full-stack thinking**â€”how frontend, backend, and APIs interact.

## **How CSA Prepared Me for Internships**  

1. **Technical Interviews** â€“ Whiteboarding Java problems felt natural after CSAâ€™s rigorous practice.  
2. **Team Projects** â€“ Companies loved that I had **real team coding experience** (not just solo work).  
3. **Debugging Mindset** â€“ CSAâ€™s emphasis on **methodical problem-solving** made me stand out.  

**Funny Story:** In one internship interview, I mentioned Mr. Mortensenâ€™s "Rubber Duck" methodâ€”the interviewer laughed and said, *"We do that here too!"*

## **What Iâ€™d Tell My Past Self**  
- **"Trust the process."** CSAâ€™s workload felt intense, but it built discipline.  
- **"Teamwork > Solo Genius."** Learning to collaborate made me a better developer.  
- **"Projects matter more than grades."** The stock simulator became my **#1 interview talking point**.

### **Final Thoughts**  
CSA wasnâ€™t just a coding classâ€”it was a **crash course in professionalism, teamwork, and building real-world systems**. The stock game project alone opened doors for me, and the **soft skills I learned** (communication, debugging patience, Agile workflows) have been **just as valuable as the technical ones**.  

Shoutout to **Mr. Mortensen** for running the class like a **mini tech company**â€”it prepared me more than I realized at the time.

**Question for Readers:**  
*What was the most impactful project you built in school? How did it help you later?*
