    "# Graph Heuristics: An Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Are Graph Heuristics?\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph heuristics are simple, fast strategies used to solve complex graph problems when finding the perfect solution would take too much time or computational resources. Think of them as \"educated guesses\" that help us make good decisions quickly in network-based problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods are particularly valuable in real-world applications like GPS navigation, network routing, game AI, and resource allocation, where getting a reasonably good answer fast is more important than finding the theoretically perfect solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "**Heuristic**: An estimation or \"rule of thumb\" that guides decision-making without guaranteeing the optimal result. In graph problems, heuristics estimate the cost or distance to reach a goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exact Algorithm**: A method that guarantees finding the optimal (best possible) solution, but may require significant time and computational resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approximation**: A solution that is \"good enough\" - close to optimal but not necessarily perfect.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cost Function**: A way to measure how expensive or difficult it is to move from one node to another in a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Admissible Heuristic**: A heuristic that never overestimates the actual cost to reach the goal, ensuring that algorithms using it will find optimal solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Trade-off: Speed vs. Perfection\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm systematically explore all possible paths to guarantee the best solution. However, this thoroughness comes at a cost - they can be slow on large graphs because they don't use any estimation or intuition about where the goal might be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph heuristics change this equation by introducing **estimation** into the search process. Instead of blindly exploring every possibility, they make educated guesses about which directions are most promising, allowing them to find good solutions much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental principle: **Heuristic = Estimation**. This estimation guides the algorithm toward promising areas of the graph while avoiding less likely paths."

    "## Greedy Best First Search\n",
    "\n",
    "### So What is Greedy Best-First Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Greedy Best-First Search (or Greedy BFS) is a graph algorithm that only looks ahead. It tries to get to the goal as fast as possible by always going to the node that looks closest to the goal—but it only uses the estimate (the heuristic), not the actual cost it took to get there.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're trying to drive to a city far away. You ahve to open your map and just start going toward the city that looks the closest to your destination (The Straight Line Distance) even if it takes you through mountains.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's what greedy BFS does. It trusts the estimate blindly\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\t1.\tYou start at a node.\n",
    "\t2.\tLook at all neighboring nodes.\n",
    "\t3.\tChoose the one with the lowest estimated distance to the goal (the smallest heuristic).\n",
    "\t4.\tRepeat until you find the goal.\n",

    "- C has h(n) = 3\n",
    "- B has h(n) = 5\n",
    "- You would choose C since 3 < 5\n",
    "\n",
    "This is \"greedy\" because it only looks at the heuristic value (straight-line distance) and picks the smallest one, without considering the actual path cost to get there.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm might not always find the shortest path, but it usually finds a reasonable path quickly.\n",

    "## Key Points to Remember\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **A* is optimal** when using an admissible heuristic (never overestimates)\n",
    "2. **Faster than Dijkstra's** because it uses heuristic guidance\n",
    "3. **More reliable than Greedy** because it considers actual costs\n",
    "4. **The heuristic matters** - better heuristics lead to faster searches\n",
    "5. **Memory usage** can be high for large graphs (stores many nodes)\n",

    "- GPS navigation systems\n",
    "- Network routing with known destinations\n",

    "- Memory is extremely limited\n",
    "- You need to find paths to multiple goals\n",
