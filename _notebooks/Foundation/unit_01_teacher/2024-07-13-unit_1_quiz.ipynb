    "### Question 5 \n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Define primitive types and reference types in Java. The application is for banking, where you need to represent customer information.\n",
    "Primitive Types:\n",
    "- Primitive types are the most basic data types in Java that represent single values. They are not objects and hold their values directly. Java has eight primitive types: int, char, byte, short, long, float, double, and boolean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference Types:\n",
    "- Reference types, on the other hand, are used to refer to objects. They hold references (memory addresses) to the actual data, which is stored in the heap memory. Classes, arrays, and interfaces are examples of reference types.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Add comments for primitive types and reference types. In terms of memory allocation, discuss concepts like instance, stack, and heap where it adds value.\n",
    "- Stack: Memory for primitive types and references to objects is allocated on the stack. Stack memory is used for method call frames and stores local variables. It is limited in size and has a Last In, First Out (LIFO) structure, meaning that when a method call ends, its local variables are removed from the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Heap: The heap is used for dynamic memory allocation of objects created with the new keyword. It is larger than the stack and can hold multiple objects, allowing for flexible memory usage. Objects stored in the heap remain in memory until they are no longer referenced.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instance: Each time you create a new instance of a class, memory is allocated on the heap for that object. This includes space for its instance variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) To assist in requirements, here are some required elements:\n",
    "- Create multiple customers from the `public class Account`.\n",
    "- Consider key class variables that a Bank may require: `name`, `balance`, `accountNumber`.\n",
    "- Create a two argument constructor using `name` and `balance`.\n",
    "- Consider in constructor how you will create a unique account number using `static int lastAccountNumber`\n",
    "- Define a method `calculateInterest` that works with getting and setting `double balance` using `private static double interestRate`."
